### Name of Student: Sarah Andyshak

### Name of Project: In-Season Food Finder (need something catchier)

### Project's Purpose or Goal:
* A friend requested this site with a lot of specifics and I thought it was a great idea. The splash page will have fruits and vegetables, my friend requested that they be arranged like a color wheel (this will take research into best placement method). If you click on an item, it will take you to a page with information about when it is in season. My friend also requested links to recipes and local farmers markets, and I think I can incorporate some form of all of these requests.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Splash page with fruits and vegetables
* Link to seasonal availablity information
* Link to at least one recipe
* Link to at least one farmers market

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* C# and/or React. Currently researching which would be best and how they might be combined.
* HTML, CSS, probably Bootstrap for styling.
* APIs:Google Maps OR Department of Agriculture for locating farmers markets; pre-built or create one for recipes -- if I decide not to do this, then I may link to recipe sites -- to be researched.

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Depending on how the build goes, APIs may fall into this category.
* Getting fruits and vegetables placed as a color wheel and acting as links.
* Including some sort of animation.
* Using Identity Framework to create a personalized experience -- if C# is part of the project.

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* I'm researching integrating C# and React today (4/28/23) and will be reading about APIs and React, and Firestorm.

#### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* I'd like feedback on any thoughts about technology that would be most conducive to this project!
