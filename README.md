## Research points:

#### Friday, 28 April 2023
* Key issue to resolve today: write in C# or React; or both. 

- [x] How do C# and React work together -- seems to be based on writing C# APIs
- [x] Is one better than the other for this project -- seems like React will be better
- [ ] Look into Firebase, Firestore
- [ ] APIs and React
- [ ] How does navigation work in React -- separate pages, or just views in the virtual DOM
- [x] Is C# or React more used by front end -- React is far and away used by frontend

### Project specific:
* Google maps API or Dept of Agriculture's API for farmer's market locations
* Recipe API or link to recipe sites

## Future research, or if time today: 
* Placement of images of fruits and veggies -- better as one large image, or several smaller
* Linking to pages for each fruit/veggie
* Drop-down menus?
