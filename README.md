* Key issue to resolve today: write in C# or React; or both. 

## Research points:
* How do C# and React work together
* Is one better than the other for this project
* APIs and React
* Look into Firestorm
* How does navigation work in React
* Is C# or React more used by front end

### Project specific:
* Google maps API or Dept of Agriculture's API for farmer's market locations
* Recipe API or link to recipe sites

## Future research, or if time today: 
* Placement of images of fruits and veggies -- better as one large image, or several smaller
* Linking to pages for each fruit/veggie
* Drop-down menus?
